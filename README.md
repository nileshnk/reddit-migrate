## Usage Guide

### Authentication Methods

Choose between two authentication methods:

#### Method 1: OAuth Authentication (Recommended)

1. **Create Reddit App**: Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. **Click "Create App"** and select "web app"
3. **Set redirect URI** to: `http://localhost:5005/api/oauth/callback`
4. **Copy Client ID and Secret** from your created app
5. **Enter credentials** in the OAuth tab and follow the authentication flow

#### Method 2: Cookie Authentication (Alternative)

1. Log in to Reddit in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Visit [reddit.com/api/me.json](https://www.reddit.com/api/me.json)
5. Find the request in the Network tab
6. Copy the entire cookie value
7. Repeat for your other Reddit account

[See visual guide](./docs/assets/cookie-retrieval.gif)

### Run the Migration

1. **Authenticate** both accounts using your preferred method
2. **Verify** the accounts are properly connected
3. **Select** what you want to migrate
4. **Submit** to start the migration

> **Note**: Large migrations (50+ saved posts) may take several minutes due to Reddit's rate limiting. Keep the browser tab open until completion.

## How It Works

Reddit-Migrate uses Reddit's official APIs with support for both OAuth and cookie-based authentication to transfer data between accounts.

- **OAuth Authentication**: Uses Reddit's official OAuth flow for secure API access with proper scopes
- **Cookie Authentication**: Extracts access tokens from Reddit cookies as an alternative method
- **Smart Migration**: Automatically detects existing items and only migrates new content to avoid duplicates
- **Subreddit Migration**: Fetches all subscribed subreddits and subscribes to them in batches of 100
- **Saved Posts**: Retrieves saved posts in proper chronological order and saves them individually
- **User Follows**: Transfers followed user accounts to the new account

The tool runs entirely locally on your machine - no data is sent to external servers.
